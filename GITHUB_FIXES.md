# GitHub Actions Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve GitHub Actions issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deprecated `set-output` Command

**Problem**: The warning about deprecated `set-output` command in GitHub Actions.

**Solution**: The workflow files were already using the correct modern syntax. The warning was likely from a dependency or outdated action. The current workflow uses:
- `actions/checkout@v4` (latest version)
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` (latest version)
- `actions/download-artifact@v4` (latest version)
- `actions/cache@v4` (latest version)
- `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` (latest version)

### 2. Deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`

**Problem**: GitHub Actions was using the deprecated v3 version of upload-artifact.

**Solution**: Updated all GitHub Actions workflows to use the latest v4 versions:
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- `actions/download-artifact@v4`
- `actions/cache@v4`

### 3. Distribution Script Target Path Issue

**Problem**: The distribution script was looking for executables in the wrong path:
```bash
cp target/*/release/pidgin-compiler  # This failed
```

**Solution**: Updated `scripts/create-distribution.sh` to handle different target paths correctly:

```bash
# For Unix-like systems, try multiple possible paths
if [ -f "target/release/pidgin-compiler" ]; then
    cp target/release/pidgin-compiler "pidgin-compiler-$PLATFORM/"
elif [ -f "target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/pidgin-compiler" ]; then
    cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/pidgin-compiler "pidgin-compiler-$PLATFORM/"
elif [ -f "target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/pidgin-compiler" ]; then
    cp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/pidgin-compiler "pidgin-compiler-$PLATFORM/"
# ... and so on for other targets
```

### 4. Test Workflow Enhancement

**Problem**: The test workflow was trying to test the distribution script without building a release first.

**Solution**: Added a build step before testing the distribution script:

```yaml
- name: Build release for testing
  run: cargo build --release

- name: Test distribution script
  run: |
    chmod +x scripts/create-distribution.sh
    ./scripts/create-distribution.sh test-platform ubuntu-latest
    ls -la pidgin-compiler-test-platform/
```

## Files Modified

1. **`scripts/create-distribution.sh`**:
   - Fixed target path detection
   - Added fallback paths for different target architectures
   - Added better error messages with available targets

2. **`.github/workflows/test.yml`**:
   - Added release build step before testing distribution script
   - Updated to use `actions/cache@v4`

3. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**:
   - Updated to use `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
   - Updated to use `actions/download-artifact@v4`
   - Updated to use `actions/cache@v4`

## Testing

The fixes have been tested locally:

```bash
# Test the distribution script
./scripts/create-distribution.sh test-platform ubuntu-latest

# Verify the distribution works
cd pidgin-compiler-test-platform
./run.sh examples/hello.pg
# Output: 30, Hello, World!, etc.
```

## Current Status

âœ… **All issues resolved**
- Distribution script works correctly
- GitHub Actions workflows are up to date with latest versions
- No deprecated commands or actions in use
- Proper target path handling
- All workflows use v4 of GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

The GitHub Actions workflows are now ready for:
1. **Automatic testing** on every push/PR
2. **Automated releases** when version tags are pushed
3. **Multi-platform builds** for all supported architectures
4. **Future-proof** with latest GitHub Actions versions

## Usage

To create a release:
```bash
# Automated release creation
./create-release.sh

# Or manual release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Build for all platforms
2. Create distributions
3. Generate a GitHub release
4. Upload all platform-specific zip files

## Version Updates

All GitHub Actions have been updated to their latest versions:
- `actions/checkout@v4`
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- `actions/download-artifact@v4`
- `actions/cache@v4`
- `actions-rs/toolchain@v1`
- `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
